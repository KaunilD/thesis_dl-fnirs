### Notes

1. [binary](https://github.com/KaunilD/thesis_dl-fnirs/tree/master/data/binary)

   1. contains train/test/val data with binary labels - 0, 1 segregated into corresponding folders.
   2. 0 - high workload, 1 - no workload
   3. data generated by this script: [cnn_dataloading_pipeline-binary.ipynb](https://github.com/KaunilD/thesis_dl-fnirs/blob/master/scripts/python/notebooks/cnn_dataloading_pipeline-binary.ipynb)

2. [multilabel](https://github.com/KaunilD/thesis_dl-fnirs/tree/master/data/multilabel)

   1. contains train/test/val data as .npy files.

   2. each npy is an array with 2 items: 

      1. a sx5x22 array where s is the task duration
      2. b*3 0/1 vector where b stands for cognitive workload item and 3 is high low off.
