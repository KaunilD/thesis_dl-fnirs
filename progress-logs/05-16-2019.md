### Progress
1. We have a stable pipeline for preprocessing the data in matlab. Now this means any kind of fNIRS data as long as I have the wavelength and sampling period. This pipeline gives us CSVs which can then be ingested by our machine learning pipeline. Scripts here:

2. Deep Learning pipeline has been setup as well. This requires loading the preprocessed CSV data into MxN numpy arrays such that the array dimensions correspond to the probe configurations mentioned in the MES CSVs. A CNN trained CNN model and the deep learning pipeline is stored here: https://github.com/lmhirshf/working_memory_fnirs/tree/kaunild/scripts
