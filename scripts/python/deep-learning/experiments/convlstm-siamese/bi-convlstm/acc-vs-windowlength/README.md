#### Cross Validation Results

##### Accuracy vs. Convolution Time Window

Each of these values are the result of 10 fold cross validation with 29 participants, leaving 6 participants out at every validation run. Dataset for each of the 10 fold CV runs across time window values is the same for consistency in results. The **task performance** cut-off for these validation runs for **90%** and **10%** of the dataset is  **0.9** and **0.6** respectively. Data is **normalized across participants**.
